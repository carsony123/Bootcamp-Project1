## Overview

Our project focused on the lasting effects of the covid 19 pandemic over the 2020-2021 time
period while prioritizing the top 10 most populated countries. Specifically, we will be monitoring how
covid-19 affected educational enrollment, economic levels, and general well-being. In
conclusion we hope to properly display the lasting affects covid-19 had on the world.

## Research Questions

* What was the number of new cases reported per country during its peak?
* How long did it take each country to reach its peak infection rate?
* 
* How did Covid-19 effect mental health in a 2 year time period?
